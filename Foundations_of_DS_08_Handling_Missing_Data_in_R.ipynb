        "\n",
        "In this lecture notes, we will deal with a dataset for a predictive task.\n",
        "If such a dataset has $p+1$ columns, we assume that $p$ are the independent variables (also known as the features, or the inputs) and one column is the dependent variable (also known as the label or the output).\n",
        "Eventually, our task will be that of devising and training a machine learning model that predicts the label based on the features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Missing data are values at specific rows (i.e., observations) and columns (i.e., features) that are not available in the dataset.\n",
        "It is important to remark that, to train a prediction model, missing data can be in one of the feature columns but **not** in the label column.\n",
        "An observation without a valid label is not serviceable and must be discarded.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a piece of data seems to be missing from a dataset, i.e., there is an \"empty\" cell in a tabular dataset, we must first determine if the missingness of the data is a valid state or not.\n",
        "To make an example, if a column reports the environment temperature in a room, and one value is missing, this is not a valid state.\n",
        "In real life, the room certainly had a temperature and not having recorded it is a \"defect\" in our data, but does not correspond to a valid world-state.\n",
        "On the other hand, if a column reports the date when a customer ended their subscription, we would expect this column to have missing data for all the current customers (i.e., those who have not ended their subscription).\n",
        "\n",
        "If we can determine that the missingness of the value is *not* a valid state, we can attempt to classify it into one of three common types: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR).\n",
        "\n",
        "Values are **missing completely at random** if their missingness is unrelated to both observable and unobservable variables.\n",
        "For example, consider a temperature sensor that sometimes stops working, and it is not possible to associate this malfunction with any other environmental parameter (both inside and outside of our dataset).\n",
        "In this case, the temperature values that are not reported due to the sensor's malfunction are missing completely at random.\n",
        "Remark that, for MCAR data, the probability that a value is missing is independent of the data and is the same for all values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Values are **missing at random** if their missingness depends on some observed property of the data.\n",
        "For example, if the temperature sensor is more likely to stop working in highly humid environments, then data recorded where humidity is high has a higher chance of containing a missing value.\n",
        "If the humidity level is not recorded, there is no way to determine this correlation from the data.\n",
        "But if the humidity level *is* recorded, a preliminary data analysis might reveal the correlation between humidity and the probability that the temperature is missing.\n",
        "It's important to remark that, assuming that humidity is the only factor affecting the sensor's reliability, if we could separate our data by humidity, missing data *for a given humidity level* would be MCAR.\n",
        "\n",
        "Values are **missing not at random** when the missingness of a value is related to the value that this variable would have if it were not missing.\n",
        "Imagine that the temperature sensor has a high chance of stop working at high temperatures.\n",
        "Then, high temperature values are more likely to be missing.\n",
        "But, precisely because these values are missing, we have no direct way to suspect that high temperatures are associated with a higher chance of missing values."

        "\n",
        "We reinforce a basic concept of imputation: the **label** cannot be used for imputation; not even indirectly.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have already stated that the label cannot be imputed, i.e., it cannot be used directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, the label cannot be used indirectly.\n",
        "For example, we cannot impute different values depending on the label.\n",
        "The reason is that, in production, the new data that comes in only has the features but not the label (because, indeed, we must *predict* the label).\n",
        "Therefore, in production, it would be impossible to employ a technique that uses the label to impute feature values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Do not cause information leakage!\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous example, we have imputed the data directly into the `pandas` dataframe.\n",
        "This means that we used potentially all observations to compute the statistics (mean in our case, median and mode in other cases) that were then used for imputation.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you will soon see, when a dataset is used for a predictive task, it is often first divided into training data and test data.\n",
        "The training data is used to train the machine learning models.\n",
        "For parametric models, training involves learning good values for their parameters: values that enable the model to make accurate predictions when presented with new data.\n",
        "During training, we select parameter values that yield a low prediction error, i.e., those that enable the model to predict labels that are close to the ground-truth label.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we are really interested in knowing how models will perform when deployed in production.\n",
        "We also want to appraise their future performance before actually deploying them in production.\n",
        "For example, if we must choose between two different models, we want to select the best one before it is deployed, not after.\n",
        "To this end, we do not use all our available data for training; instead, we split the data into two parts.\n",
        "The training data is used to train the models, while the test data is used as a \"simulation\" of future production data and is only used to evaluate the models.\n",
        "For this evaluation to be unbiased, the test data must be kept completely separate from the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose we impute missing values in our dataset before this separation.\n",
        "In that case, some test points will be included in the calculation of the statistics (such as the mean) used in data imputation.\n",
        "Therefore, best practices involve using only training data for imputation and then applying the statistics computed on the training data to impute values in the test data.\n",
        "This approach avoids *information leakage*, i.e., that some information contained in the test data leaks, however indirectly, into the training data.\n",
        "In Python, this is achieved by using pipelines and including the imputation step in the pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "You have not yet studied machine learning models and the `sklearn` library.\n",
        "Come back to the following code in a couple of weeks to learn how to perform imputation correctly when the data you are imputing is used to train machine learning algorithms."
