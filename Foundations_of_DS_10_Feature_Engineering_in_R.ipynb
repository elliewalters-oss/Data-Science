# ========================================
# Initial Data Preparation
# ========================================

# Mutations on `lifeboat` and `fare` can be considered
# as feature engineering already.

d <- d %>%
  select(-c(name, ticket, body_id_number)) %>%
  mutate(
    lifeboat = as_factor(if_else(is.na(lifeboat), "No", "Yes")),
    fare = if_else(fare == 0, NaN, fare),
    pclass = as_factor(pclass),
    sex = as_factor(sex),
    embarkment_port = as_factor(embarkment_port)
  )

# Feature Engineering in Tibbles
# ========================================

# Dplyr can be useful for performing some quick feature engineering.
# However, if the computed feature for a given observation depends on other observations
# (which can potentially end up in the test/validation datasets), such a transformation
# can cause information leakage.
# Such transformations should be done exclusively via the `recipes` package to prevent
# information leakage.

# Another reason why you might want to use recipes instead of `dplyr` for feature
# engineering is that recipes do not modify the original data nor require that you make
# multiple copies of it.
# This means that you can easily evaluate the impact of each transformation and even
# perform rigorous model selection on the combined transformation+prediction model.

# Therefore, if the data will be used for a prediction task, I generally advise to use
# recipes. Transform the data using `dplyr` only for preliminary analyses and to
# visualise the transformations.
# However, I must be honest: the `recipes` package is not yet as developed, used,
# polished and easy to use as are `sklearn`'s pipelines.
# Therefore, this might be an area in which Python users are at a slight advantage.

# ========================================
# Combining Multiple Features into One
# ========================================

# Features can be combined to decrease their number, especially in case there are many
# independent variables compared to the dataset size.
# For example, in the Titanic dataset, we might combine the `siblings_and_spouses_onboard`
# and the `parents_and_children_onboard` columns into a generic `family_size` column.
# Because this combination is performed row-wise, no information leakage will happen.

d_reduced <- d %>%
  mutate(family_size = siblings_and_spouses_onboard + parents_and_children_onboard) %>%
  select(-c(siblings_and_spouses_onboard, parents_and_children_onboard))

# View the first few rows
head(d_reduced)

# ========================================
# Creating Interaction Terms
# ========================================

# An interaction term is obtained by combining two existing features into a new one.
# Usually, the features used in the interaction are not removed.
# A typical example is to add product features that will then be fed to a linear model.
# Because a linear model cannot represent any multiplicative interaction among features
# (unlike, e.g., a neural network), such features can be hand-crafted.

# In the following example, we create an interaction feature between the `age` and
# `fare` columns.

d_interaction <- d %>%
  mutate(age_fare_interaction = age * fare)

# View the first few rows
head(d_interaction)

# ========================================
# Numerical Transformations
# ========================================

# Depending on the distribution of a feature's value, it might useful to apply some
# numerical transformation to it.
# For example, if the relationship between a feature and the label is close to
# exponential and we are using a linear regression model, we can take the logarithm
# of the feature.
# Other times, we take the logarithm of an independent variable for a more prosaic
# reason: it can help the training algorithm converge faster.
# For further references, please see:
# https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/298

# View the distribution of fare before transformation
hist(d$fare, main = "Histogram of fare", xlab = "fare")

# --- Log Transform ---
d_logfare <- d %>%
  mutate(fare = log(fare))

# View the distribution after log transformation
hist(d_logfare$fare, main = "Histogram of fare (log-transformed)", xlab = "fare")

# Other times, numerical instability can result from using features with values of
# very different magnitude.
# For example, if some features have values of magnitude 10^6 and others have values
# of magnitude 10^-3.
# In this case, one can apply transformations that reduce the range of the numeric
# variables.
# In the process, one can also transform their distribution.
# Such transformations can even be applied to the label and, in many case, increase
# the out-of-sample accuracy of machine learning models.

# Virtually all these transformations use information computed on the entire dataset.
# Therefore, they should always be used with `recipes` if the resulting data is used
# to train and validate a machine learning model.
# The two most common transformations are:
# * Standardisation, i.e., subtracting the mean from each value and then dividing by
#   the standard deviation. In this case, when splitting our data into training and
#   test set, the mean and the standard deviation should be computed *on the training
#   data only* and then used for both training and test data. In R, you can use the
#   `scale()` function to apply such transformation to a tibble's column.
# * Quantile transforms map a feature's probability distribution into a known one,
#   usually a normal pdf or a uniform pdf. This transformation relies on an estimation
#   of the cdf of a given feature. Again, this estimation should only use training
#   data and the estimated parameters can then be used on the training as well as the
#   test data. In R, you can use the `rank()` function to apply such transformation
#   to a tibble's column.

# --- Standardisation ---
d_std_fare <- d %>%
  mutate(fare = scale(fare))

# View the first few rows
head(d_std_fare)

# --- Quantile Transform (Normal Distribution) ---
d_norm_fare <- d %>%
  mutate(fare = qnorm(rank(fare, ties.method = "average") / (n() + 1)))

# View the distribution after normal quantile transformation
hist(d_norm_fare$fare, main = "Histogram of fare (quantile normal)", xlab = "fare")

# --- Quantile Transform (Uniform Distribution) ---
d_unif_fare <- d %>%
  mutate(fare = rank(fare, ties.method = "average") / (n() + 1))

# View the distribution after uniform quantile transformation
hist(d_unif_fare$fare, main = "Histogram of fare (quantile uniform)", xlab = "fare")

# ========================================
# Binning
# ========================================

# Binning can refer to a couple of distinct procedures.

# First, it can mean transforming a numeric feature into a categorical one, depending
# on value bins.
# For example, we could bin the ages into 'Infant', 'Young', 'Middle-age', 'Elderly'.
# This procedure is rarely useful and, in general, it tends to worsen the predictive
# power of a properly tuned and trained model.

# Second, it can mean decreasing the number of categories of a categorical variable
# by merging some of them.
# When a categorical variable has very high cardinality, this procedure can be useful.
# For example, in our data, the cabin data has high cardinality.
# However, when a cabin is present, it is composed of two parts: the deck, indicated
# by a letter, and the room number.
# One can imagine that being on a lower deck would result in a lower probability of
# getting onboard a lifeboat.
# Therefore, we could bin our cabins into decks.

d_deck <- d %>%
  mutate(deck = as_factor(str_extract(cabin, "[A-Z]"))) %>%
  select(-cabin)

# View the first few rows
head(d_deck)
